# Step 8 -- Remediation

## Triage Outcome

**Case A** applies: versions 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2 within the issue's scoped
stream (2.2.x) are affected.

**Case B** also applies: stream 2.1.x (outside the issue scope) is also
affected (versions 2.1.0, 2.1.1 both ship quinn-proto 0.11.9). Since
TC-8001 is scoped to 2.2.x, the 2.1.x impact is handled via proactive
(preemptive) remediation tasks.

Ecosystem: **Cargo** (source dependency) -- two tasks per stream:
1. Upstream backport task (fix in rhtpa-backend source repo)
2. Downstream propagation subtask (update reference in Konflux release repo)

## Case A: Remediation Tasks for Stream 2.2.x (Issue Scope)

### Task 1: Upstream Backport (2.2.x)

**PROPOSAL: Create Jira Task**

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-31812"]
)
```

#### Task Description

```
## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts.
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0 (v0.4.5, quinn-proto 0.11.9),
RHTPA 2.2.1 (v0.4.8, quinn-proto 0.11.12),
RHTPA 2.2.2 (v0.4.9, retag of 2.2.1, quinn-proto 0.11.12)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

### Coordination Guidance

This component is public upstream. Coordinate fix with upstream maintainers
if the vulnerability is not yet public. Follow your organization's embargo
policy before discussing in public channels or PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation (2.2.x)

**PROPOSAL: Create Jira Task**

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-31812"]
)
```

#### Task Description

```
## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from <upstream-task-key>.

The upstream backport (<upstream-task-key>) bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag, e.g., v0.4.12)
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

### Coordination Guidance

This component is public upstream. Coordinate fix with upstream maintainers
if the vulnerability is not yet public. Follow your organization's embargo
policy before discussing in public channels or PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: <upstream-task-key> (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)
```

#### Linkage

```
jira.create_link(
  inwardIssue: "TC-8001",
  outwardIssue: <downstream-task-key>,
  type: "Depend"
)

jira.create_link(
  inwardIssue: <upstream-task-key>,
  outwardIssue: <downstream-task-key>,
  type: "Blocks"
)
```

## Case B: Preemptive Remediation Tasks for Stream 2.1.x (Cross-Stream)

Stream 2.1.x is also affected (all versions ship quinn-proto 0.11.9) but has
no stream-specific CVE Jira (TC-8001 is scoped to 2.2.x only). Proactive
remediation tasks are created with the `security-preemptive` label and
"Related" link type.

### PROPOSAL: Post Cross-Stream Impact Comment on TC-8001

```
jira.add_comment("TC-8001",
  "Cross-stream impact: quinn-proto < 0.11.14 also affects stream 2.1.x
  based on lock file analysis.
  - RHTPA 2.1.0 (v0.3.8): quinn-proto 0.11.9 (affected)
  - RHTPA 2.1.1 (v0.3.12): quinn-proto 0.11.9 (affected)

  This stream is not tracked by a companion CVE issue.
  Preemptive remediation tasks will be created.
