### Failed Assertions

<details>
<summary>eval-17: 1 failing assertion</summary>

- **Assertion:** "The embargo warning gate does NOT trigger for Low or Moderate severity CVEs (CVSS &lt; 7.0) — it is skipped silently when severity is below threshold (§1.70)"
  **Evidence:** "The outputs only demonstrate the above-threshold case (CVSS 7.5, High). While embargo-check.md defines the threshold as 'CVSS &gt;= 7.0' and evaluates 'Threshold met? YES -- 7.5 &gt;= 7.0', there is no explicit statement about what happens when the threshold is NOT met. The outputs do not state that the gate is skipped silently for CVSS &lt; 7.0, nor is there any below-threshold scenario demonstrated. No evidence in any output file addresses the behavior for Low or Moderate severity CVEs."
