# Step 8 -- Remediation: TC-8001

## Triage Outcome

**Case A + Case B**: The scoped 2.2.x stream has affected versions (2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2), so remediation tasks are created for 2.2.x. The 2.1.x stream is also affected (cross-stream impact), and no stream-specific CVE Jira exists for 2.1.x, so preemptive remediation tasks are created for 2.1.x.

Ecosystem: **Cargo** (source dependency) -- two tasks per stream (upstream backport + downstream propagation).

No Coordination Guidance subsection is included because the Source Repositories table does not have a Deployment Context column (backward compatibility).

## Task 1: Upstream Backport -- 2.2.x Stream

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.2.x)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`

### Description

## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts (denial of service).
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto versions before 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: 2.2.0 (v0.4.5, quinn-proto 0.11.9), 2.2.1 (v0.4.8, quinn-proto 0.11.12), 2.2.2 (v0.4.9, retag of 2.2.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

## Task 2: Downstream Propagation -- 2.2.x Stream

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (2.2.x)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`

### Description

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag, e.g., v0.4.12)
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

## Task 3: Preemptive Upstream Backport -- 2.1.x Stream

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`, `security-preemptive`

### Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8001 (stream 2.2.x).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.

## Jira Linkage Summary

### 2.2.x Stream (standard remediation -- Case A)

- Task 1 (upstream backport) linked to TC-8001 with link type **Depend**
- Task 2 (downstream propagation) linked to TC-8001 with link type **Depend**
- Task 2 blocked by Task 1 with link type **Blocks**

### 2.1.x Stream (preemptive remediation -- Case B)

- Task 3 (preemptive upstream backport) linked to TC-8001 with link type **Related** (not Depend, since this is a cross-stream preemptive task)
- Task 4 (preemptive downstream propagation) linked to TC-8001 with link type **Related**
- Task 4 blocked by Task 3 with link type **Blocks**

## Notes

- No Coordination Guidance subsection is included in any task because the Source Repositories table in CLAUDE.md does not have a Deployment Context column. Per backward compatibility rules, this subsection is omitted entirely rather than defaulting to any deployment context content.
- The `ai-cve-triaged` label would be added to TC-8001 after all triage actions complete.
- The Affects Versions field on TC-8001 should be corrected from `RHTPA 2.0.0` to the versions actually affected within the 2.2.x stream scope (RHTPA 2.2.0, RHTPA 2.2.1, RHTPA 2.2.2).
