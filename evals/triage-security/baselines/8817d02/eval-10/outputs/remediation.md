# Step 7 -- Remediation: TC-8020

## Triage Outcome

- **Case A (current stream rhtpa-2.2)**: Affected -- create remediation tasks
- **Case B (cross-stream rhtpa-2.1)**: Also affected, no CVE Jira exists -- create preemptive remediation tasks

## Case A: Remediation Tasks for Stream rhtpa-2.2 (Current Stream)

The issue is scoped to stream rhtpa-2.2. Versions RHTPA 2.2.0 and RHTPA 2.2.1 both ship tokio 1.41.1, which is within the affected range (< 1.42.0). The ecosystem is Cargo (source dependency), so **two tasks** are required: an upstream backport task and a downstream propagation subtask.

### Task 1: Upstream Backport Task

**PROPOSED Jira action** -- create issue:

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123"]
)
```

#### Task Description

```
## Repository

rhtpa-backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-55123: tokio use-after-free in task abort.
The vulnerable dependency (tokio < 1.42.0) must be updated
to the fixed version (1.42.0+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0 (v0.4.5, tokio 1.41.1), RHTPA 2.2.1 (v0.4.8, tokio 1.41.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7001
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-tk91-v5pp

## Implementation Notes

- Update tokio dependency to >= 1.42.0 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] tokio dependency is >= 1.42.0
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)
```

**PROPOSED Jira action** -- link issue:

```
jira.create_link(
  inwardIssue: "TC-8020",
  outwardIssue: <upstream-task-key>,
  type: "Depend"
)
```

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation Subtask

**PROPOSED Jira action** -- create issue:

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Propagate CVE-2026-55123 fix: update rhtpa-backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123"]
)
```

#### Task Description

```
## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update rhtpa-backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-55123 fix from <upstream-task-key>.

The upstream backport (<upstream-task-key>) bumps tokio to 1.42.0
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag, e.g., v0.4.12)
- Update the rhtpa-backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] rhtpa-backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: <upstream-task-key> (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)
```

**PROPOSED Jira actions** -- link issues:

```
jira.create_link(
  inwardIssue: <upstream-task-key>,
  outwardIssue: <downstream-task-key>,
  type: "Blocks"
)

jira.create_link(
  inwardIssue: "TC-8020",
  outwardIssue: <downstream-task-key>,
  type: "Depend"
)
```

## Case B: Preemptive Remediation Tasks for Stream rhtpa-2.1

Cross-stream version impact analysis shows that stream rhtpa-2.1 also ships tokio 1.40.0, which is within the affected range (< 1.42.0). A JQL search for sibling CVE Jiras with label CVE-2026-55123 returns **no results** for stream rhtpa-2.1 -- no CVE Jira exists for that stream.

Per Step 7 Case B, preemptive remediation tasks are created with the `security-preemptive` label and "Related" link type.

### Preemptive Task 1: Upstream Backport Task (rhtpa-2.1)

**PROPOSED Jira action** -- create issue:

```
jira.create_issue(
  projectKey: "TC",
  issueTypeName: "Task",
  summary: "Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.1)",
  description: <see below>,
  labels: ["ai-generated-jira", "Security", "CVE-2026-55123", "security-preemptive"]
)
