# Step 8 -- Remediation

## Triage Outcome

- **Case A** (Affected): The 2.2.x stream has affected versions (2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2). Create remediation tasks.
- **Case B** (Cross-stream impact): The 2.1.x stream is also affected (2.1.0 and 2.1.1 both ship quinn-proto 0.11.9), but no sibling CVE Jira exists for that stream. Create preemptive remediation tasks for 2.1.x.
- **Ecosystem**: Cargo (source dependency) -- create two tasks per stream (upstream backport + downstream propagation).

## Case A: Remediation Tasks for Stream 2.2.x (scoped stream)

### Task 1: Upstream Backport Task

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812

**Description**:

## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts (DoS).
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0 (quinn-proto 0.11.9), RHTPA 2.2.1 (quinn-proto 0.11.12), RHTPA 2.2.2 (retag of 2.2.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation Subtask

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812

**Description**:

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag)
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

---

## Case B: Preemptive Remediation Tasks for Stream 2.1.x (cross-stream impact)

The 2.1.x stream is also affected but has no stream-specific CVE Jira. Creating proactive remediation tasks with the `security-preemptive` label.

### Preemptive Task 1: Upstream Backport Task

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (rhtpa-2.1)

**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812, security-preemptive

**Description**:

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8001 (stream 2.2.x).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for stream 2.1.x. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.
