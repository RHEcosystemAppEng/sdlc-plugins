# Step 8 -- Remediation: CVE-2026-55123

## Triage Outcome

- **Case A**: Stream rhtpa-2.2 (2.2.x) is affected -- create remediation tasks (scoped to this issue)
- **Case B**: Stream rhtpa-2.1 (2.1.x) is also affected AND no sibling CVE Jira exists -- create preemptive remediation tasks

Ecosystem is Cargo (source dependency) -- two tasks per stream: upstream backport + downstream propagation.

## Case A: Remediation Tasks for Stream rhtpa-2.2 (current issue scope)

### Task 1: Upstream Backport (rhtpa-2.2)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-55123`

**Link**: Depend (inward: TC-8020, outward: this task)

#### Description

## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-55123: Use-after-free in task abort in tokio.
The vulnerable dependency (tokio < 1.42.0) must be updated
to the fixed version (1.42.0+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0 (tokio 1.41.1), RHTPA 2.2.1 (tokio 1.41.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7001
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-tk91-v5pp

## Implementation Notes

- Update tokio dependency to >= 1.42.0 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] tokio dependency is >= 1.42.0
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation (rhtpa-2.2)

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-55123 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-55123`

**Links**:
- Depend (inward: TC-8020, outward: this task)
- Blocks (inward: upstream backport task, outward: this task)

#### Description

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-55123 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport task bumps tokio to 1.42.0
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag)
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8020 (parent tracking issue)

---

## Case B: Preemptive Remediation Tasks for Stream rhtpa-2.1

No sibling CVE Jira exists for CVE-2026-55123 in stream rhtpa-2.1.
Creating preemptive remediation tasks with `security-preemptive` label
and "Related" link type to the originating CVE Jira TC-8020.

### Task 3: Upstream Backport -- Preemptive (rhtpa-2.1)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-55123: bump tokio to 1.42.0 (rhtpa-2.1)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-55123`, `security-preemptive`

**Link**: Related (inward: TC-8020, outward: this task)

#### Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8020 (stream rhtpa-2.2).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.
