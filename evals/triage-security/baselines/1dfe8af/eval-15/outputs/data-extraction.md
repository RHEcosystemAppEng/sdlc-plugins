## Stream Scope Resolution

The issue summary contains the suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`, which maps to the **2.2.x** version stream (Konflux release repo: `git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.4.z`).

This issue is **stream-scoped** to 2.2.x. Steps 3 and 7 will apply only to versions within the 2.2.x stream, while Step 2 will analyze all streams to detect cross-stream impact.

## Ecosystem Detection

The vulnerable library `quinn-proto` is a Rust crate. Based on the Ecosystem Mappings in the security matrix, this falls under the **Cargo** ecosystem:

- Lock file: `Cargo.lock`
- Check command: `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock`
- Source repository: backend (upstream branch: `release/0.4.z` for 2.2.x stream)

For Cargo ecosystem, remediation requires **two tasks**: an upstream backport task (source repo fix) and a downstream propagation subtask (Konflux release repo update).
