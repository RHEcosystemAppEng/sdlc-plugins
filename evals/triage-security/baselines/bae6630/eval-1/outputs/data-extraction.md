## Stream Scope Resolution

The issue summary contains the suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`, which maps to the **2.2.x** version stream in the Security Configuration Version Streams table (Konflux Release Repo: `git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.4.z`).

This issue is **stream-scoped** to 2.2.x. Steps 3 and 7 will only apply to versions within the 2.2.x stream. Cross-stream impact on the 2.1.x stream will be reported via Case B (cross-stream impact notice).

## Ecosystem Detection

The vulnerable library is **quinn-proto**, a Rust crate. From the Ecosystem Mappings in the 2.2.x stream's security-matrix.md:

| Ecosystem | Repository | Lock File | Check Command | Upstream Branch |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Cargo | backend | `Cargo.lock` | `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock` | `release/0.4.z` |

Ecosystem: **Cargo** (source dependency). This means remediation will require **two tasks**: an upstream backport task and a downstream propagation subtask.
