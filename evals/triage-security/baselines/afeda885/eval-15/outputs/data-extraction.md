## Stream Scope Resolution

The issue summary contains the suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`, which maps to the **2.2.x** version stream (Konflux release repo: `git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.4.z`). Steps 3-7 are scoped to this stream.

The 2.1.x stream will be analyzed for cross-stream impact (Step 7, Case B) but is not part of this issue's scope.

## Ecosystem Detection

The vulnerable library `quinn-proto` is a Rust crate. The ecosystem is **Cargo**, with lock file `Cargo.lock` and check command `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock | grep -A2 'name = "<library>"'`. This is configured in the Ecosystem Mappings table for both streams.
