# Step 8 -- Remediation: CVE-2026-31812

## Triage Decision

- Issue scope: **2.2.x** (from summary suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`)
- Affected versions in scope (2.2.x): 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2
- Not affected in scope: 2.2.3, 2.2.4
- Cross-stream impact (2.1.x): 2.1.0, 2.1.1 also affected
- Ecosystem: Cargo (source dependency) --> 2 tasks per stream (upstream + downstream)

**Case A applies**: supported versions within the issue's 2.2.x stream scope are affected.

**Case B applies**: the 2.1.x stream is also affected (cross-stream impact). Since
the issue is scoped to 2.2.x, the 2.1.x impact is handled via preemptive remediation
tasks (Case B).

## Case A -- Remediation Tasks for Stream 2.2.x

### Task 1: Upstream Backport (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`

**Link**: Depend on TC-8001 (parent Vulnerability issue)

#### Task Description

## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts (DoS).
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0 (v0.4.5, quinn-proto 0.11.9), RHTPA 2.2.1 (v0.4.8, quinn-proto 0.11.12), RHTPA 2.2.2 (v0.4.9, retag of 2.2.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- **Dependency type**: direct
- quinn-proto is a direct Cargo dependency of the backend workspace

### Remediation approach (direct dependency)

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.toml / Cargo.lock
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

### Coordination Guidance

This component is public upstream. Coordinate fix with upstream maintainers
if the vulnerability is not yet public. Follow your organization's embargo policy
before discussing in public channels or PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

---

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`

**Links**:
- Depend on TC-8001 (parent Vulnerability issue)
- Blocked by upstream backport task (Task 1 above)

#### Task Description

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: `artifacts.lock.yaml` (download URL contains tag, e.g., `v0.4.12`)
- **Dependency type**: direct -- carried forward from upstream task
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

## Case B -- Cross-Stream Impact: Preemptive Remediation for Stream 2.1.x

The version impact analysis reveals that the 2.1.x stream is also affected
(2.1.0 and 2.1.1 both ship quinn-proto 0.11.9). Since no sibling CVE Jira
exists for stream 2.1.x (no issue found with CVE-2026-31812 label and
`[rhtpa-2.1]` suffix), preemptive remediation tasks are created.

### Cross-stream impact comment (posted to TC-8001)

```
Cross-stream impact: quinn-proto < 0.11.14 also affects stream 2.1.x based
on lock file analysis. This stream is tracked by companion issues (see
Related links) or may require separate PSIRT triage.
```

### Task 3: Upstream Backport -- Preemptive (2.1.x)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (rhtpa-2.1)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`, `security-preemptive`

**Link**: Related to TC-8001 (originating CVE Jira -- "Related" not "Depend" for preemptive tasks)

#### Task Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8001 (stream 2.2.x).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.

## Preemptive Tasks Comment (posted to TC-8001)

```
Preemptive remediation tasks created for streams without CVE Jiras:
- 2.1.x: [Task 3 key] (upstream backport, security-preemptive)
- 2.1.x: [Task 4 key] (downstream propagation, security-preemptive)

These tasks use the "Related" link type and carry the security-preemptive
label. When PSIRT creates stream-specific CVE Jiras, Step 4.4
reconciliation will link them and remove the label.
```
