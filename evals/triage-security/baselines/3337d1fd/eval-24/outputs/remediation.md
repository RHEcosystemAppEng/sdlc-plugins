# Remediation Tasks for TC-8001 (CVE-2026-31812)

## Summary

- **CVE**: CVE-2026-31812 -- quinn-proto < 0.11.14 (DoS via excessive stream counts)
- **Ecosystem**: Cargo (source dependency) -- two tasks per stream (upstream + downstream)
- **Scoped stream**: 2.2.x (affected versions: 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2)
- **Cross-stream**: 2.1.x (affected versions: 2.1.0, 2.1.1) -- preemptive tasks

---

## Case A: Stream 2.2.x Remediation Tasks

### Task 1: Upstream Backport (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812

**Link**: Depend -- inward: TC-8001, outward: this task

#### Task Description

## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts.
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto versions before 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: RHTPA 2.2.0, RHTPA 2.2.1, RHTPA 2.2.2
Source commit(s): v0.4.5 (2.2.0), v0.4.8 (2.2.1), v0.4.8 (2.2.2 -- retag of 2.2.1)

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- **Dependency type**: direct

### Remediation approach (direct dependency)

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

---

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (rhtpa-2.2)

**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812

**Links**:
- Depend -- inward: TC-8001, outward: this task
- Blocks -- inward: upstream task (Task 1), outward: this task

#### Task Description

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag)
- **Dependency type**: direct -- carried forward from upstream task
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

---

## Case B: Stream 2.1.x Preemptive Remediation Tasks

Cross-stream impact: quinn-proto versions before 0.11.14 also affects stream 2.1.x
(versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 both ship quinn-proto 0.11.9). No sibling CVE Jira exists
for the 2.1.x stream. Creating preemptive remediation tasks.

### Task 3: Preemptive Upstream Backport (2.1.x)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (rhtpa-2.1)

**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812, security-preemptive

#### Task Description

## Target Branch

release/0.3.z

## Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8001 (stream 2.2.x).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.
