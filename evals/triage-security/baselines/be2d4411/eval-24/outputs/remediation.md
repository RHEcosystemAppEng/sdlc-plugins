# Step 8 -- Remediation: TC-8001 (CVE-2026-31812)

## Triage Outcome Summary

### Stream 2.2.x (scoped stream -- Case A)

- Affected versions: 2.2.0 (quinn-proto 0.11.9), 2.2.1 (quinn-proto 0.11.12), 2.2.2 (retag of 2.2.1)
- Not affected: 2.2.3 (quinn-proto 0.11.14), 2.2.4 (quinn-proto 0.11.14)
- Upstream fix status: already fixed on `release/0.4.z` (HEAD ships 0.11.14)
- Affects Versions corrected: RHTPA 2.0.0 --> RHTPA 2.2.0, RHTPA 2.2.1, RHTPA 2.2.2

Remediation tasks are created for this stream to formally track the fix. The upstream backport is already present on `release/0.4.z` (tag v0.4.11 onward), and the downstream propagation was already applied in builds 0.4.11+ (versions 2.2.3+).

### Stream 2.1.x (cross-stream impact -- Case B)

- All versions affected: 2.1.0 (quinn-proto 0.11.9), 2.1.1 (quinn-proto 0.11.9)
- Upstream fix status: NOT fixed on `release/0.3.z` (HEAD ships 0.11.9)
- No sibling CVE Jira exists for stream 2.1.x

Preemptive remediation tasks are created for this stream (Case B). Tasks carry the `security-preemptive` label and use "Related" link type to TC-8001.

## Remediation Task Descriptions -- Stream 2.2.x

### Task 1: Upstream Backport (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.2.x)
**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812
**Link**: Depend (inward: TC-8001, outward: this task)

```
## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts.
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: 2.2.0 (v0.4.5), 2.2.1 (v0.4.8), 2.2.2 (v0.4.9, retag of 2.2.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Note: quinn-proto is already at 0.11.14 on release/0.4.z as of tag v0.4.11
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)
```

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (2.2.x)
**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812
**Link**: Depend (inward: TC-8001, outward: this task); Blocks (inward: upstream task, outward: this task)

```
## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag, e.g., v0.4.12)
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Note: builds 0.4.11+ (versions 2.2.3+) already reference the fixed upstream
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)
```

## Preemptive Remediation Task Descriptions -- Stream 2.1.x (Case B)

### Task 3: Upstream Backport (2.1.x, preemptive)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.1.x)
**Labels**: ai-generated-jira, Security, CVE-2026-31812, security-preemptive

## Target Branch

release/0.3.z

## Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8001 (stream 2.2.x). No stream-specific CVE Jira exists
> yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one, this task will be linked and the
> `security-preemptive` label removed.

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts.
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: 2.1.0 (v0.3.8), 2.1.1 (v0.3.12)

## Implementation Notes

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.3.z
- Upstream branch release/0.3.z currently ships quinn-proto 0.11.9 -- fix is NOT yet present
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency
