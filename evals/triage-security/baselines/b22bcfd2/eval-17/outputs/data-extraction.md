## Stream Scope Resolution

The issue summary contains stream suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`, which maps to the **2.2.x** version stream from the Version Streams table. This issue is scoped to the 2.2.x stream only.

## Ecosystem Detection

The vulnerable library is **quinn-proto**, a Rust crate. Checking the Ecosystem Mappings table in the 2.2.x stream's security-matrix.md:

| Ecosystem | Repository | Lock File | Check Command | Upstream Branch |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Cargo | backend | `Cargo.lock` | `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock` | `release/0.4.z` |
| RPM | -- | `rpms.lock.yaml` | `git show <tag>:rpms.lock.yaml` | -- |

quinn-proto is a Cargo (Rust crate) dependency. The ecosystem is **Cargo**, which is listed in the Ecosystem Mappings table. Investigation method: lock file inspection via `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock`.

## Deployment Context Lookup

The Source Repositories table in this configuration does **not** include a Deployment Context column. Per Step 0, all repositories default to `upstream`. No Coordination Guidance subsection will be added to remediation task descriptions.
