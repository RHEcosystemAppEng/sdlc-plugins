## Data Quality Assessment

The Jira description contains **imprecise** version data:
- "Affected versions: versions prior to the fix" -- no specific version threshold
- "Fixed version: see advisory" -- defers to external advisory

**External CVE data enrichment (Step 1.5) is required** to obtain precise fix thresholds for version impact analysis.
