## Stream Scope Resolution

The issue summary contains the stream suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`, which maps to the **2.2.x** version stream (Konflux release repo: `git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.4.z`). This issue is **stream-scoped** to 2.2.x only.

## Ecosystem Detection

The vulnerable library is **quinn-proto**. Based on the task context, ecosystem detection resolves to **Go modules**.

### Ecosystem Mappings check (2.2.x stream)

The Ecosystem Mappings table for the 2.2.x stream (`rhtpa-release.0.4.z`) lists:

| Ecosystem | Repository | Lock File | Check Command | Upstream Branch |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Cargo | backend | `Cargo.lock` | `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock` | `release/0.4.z` |
| RPM | -- | `rpms.lock.yaml` | `git show <tag>:rpms.lock.yaml` | -- |

**Result**: **Go modules** is NOT listed in the Ecosystem Mappings table. The supported ecosystems for this stream are Cargo and RPM only. Automated triage cannot proceed for this ecosystem.

## Deployment Context Lookup

The affected repository derived from `pscomponent:org/rhtpa-server` maps to **rhtpa-backend** in the Source Repositories table. Its deployment context defaults to **upstream** (no Deployment Context column present in the configuration).
