## Stream Scope Resolution

- Summary suffix: `[rhtpa-2.2]`
- Mapped stream: **2.2.x** (Konflux release repo: `rhtpa-release.0.4.z`)
- Issue is **scoped** to the 2.2.x stream

## Ecosystem Detection

- Library: quinn-proto (Rust crate)
- Ecosystem: **Cargo**
- Category: Source dependency
- Lock file: `Cargo.lock`
- Check command: `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock | grep -A2 'name = "quinn-proto"'`

## Deployment Context

- Affected repository: rhtpa-backend
- Deployment context: **upstream** (default -- no Deployment Context column in Source Repositories table)

## Affects Versions Mismatch

The PSIRT-assigned Affects Versions (`RHTPA 2.0.0`) does not match any configured version stream. There is no 2.0.x stream -- the configured streams are 2.1.x and 2.2.x. This will be corrected in Step 3 based on lock file evidence.
