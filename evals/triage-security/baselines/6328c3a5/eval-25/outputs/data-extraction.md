## Stream Scope Resolution

The issue summary contains the stream suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`, which maps to the **2.2.x** version stream configured in Security Configuration. This issue is **stream-scoped** to 2.2.x.

## Ecosystem Detection

The vulnerable library is **quinn-proto**. Based on the eval instruction, the ecosystem detection resolves to **Go modules**.

### Ecosystem Mappings Check

The Ecosystem Mappings tables in the security-matrix.md for both configured streams list the following supported ecosystems:

**Stream 2.1.x (rhtpa-release.0.3.z):**

| Ecosystem | Repository | Lock File | Check Command | Upstream Branch |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Cargo | backend | `Cargo.lock` | `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock` | `release/0.3.z` |
| RPM | -- | `rpms.lock.yaml` | `git show <tag>:rpms.lock.yaml` | -- |

**Stream 2.2.x (rhtpa-release.0.4.z):**

| Ecosystem | Repository | Lock File | Check Command | Upstream Branch |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Cargo | backend | `Cargo.lock` | `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock` | `release/0.4.z` |
| RPM | -- | `rpms.lock.yaml` | `git show <tag>:rpms.lock.yaml` | -- |

**Result: Go modules is NOT listed in the Ecosystem Mappings table for any configured stream.** The supported ecosystems are Cargo and RPM only. Automated triage cannot proceed for this ecosystem.

## Deployment Context

The affected repository (rhtpa-backend, matched from component label `pscomponent:org/rhtpa-server`) has deployment context: **upstream** (default, as no Deployment Context column is present in Source Repositories).
