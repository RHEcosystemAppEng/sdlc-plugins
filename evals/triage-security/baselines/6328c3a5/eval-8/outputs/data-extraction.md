## Vulnerability Description

axios package before version 1.8.2 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via a crafted URL that bypasses hostname validation. An attacker can exploit this to make requests to internal services. The vulnerability exists because axios does not properly validate the hostname in URLs when following redirects.
