## Query 1: Untriaged Issues

**JQL:**
```
project = TC AND issuetype = 10024 AND labels NOT IN (ai-cve-triaged) ORDER BY status ASC, created DESC
```

**Results (4 issues):**

### Status: New (3 issues)

## Query 2: Triaged but still New

**JQL:**
```
project = TC AND issuetype = 10024 AND labels IN (ai-cve-triaged) AND status = New ORDER BY created DESC
```

**Results (1 issue):**

| # | Issue | Status | CVE ID | Summary | Created |
|---|-------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | TC-9010 | New | CVE-2026-39874 | quinn-proto - Panic on malformed QUIC frame [rhtpa-2.2] | 2026-05-28 |

This issue was triaged (has `ai-cve-triaged` label) but remains in New status. It may need follow-up or re-triage.

## Query 3: Ready for QA

**JQL:**
```
project = TC AND issuetype = 10024 AND labels IN (ai-cve-triaged) AND status NOT IN (Closed, Verified, 'ON_QA') ORDER BY created DESC
```

**Results (3 candidates):** After filtering by linked remediation Task completion status, only issues where ALL linked Tasks (link type "Depend") are Done or Closed qualify.

### Filtering Analysis

- **TC-9020** (CVE-2026-38901): Linked remediation Tasks: TC-9021 (Done), TC-9022 (Closed). ALL completed. **Qualifies for Ready for QA.**
- **TC-9023** (CVE-2026-39102): Linked remediation Tasks: TC-9024 (Done), TC-9025 (In Progress). TC-9025 is still In Progress. **Excluded** — remediation is not complete.
- **TC-9026** (CVE-2026-39330): No linked Tasks with link type "Depend". **Excluded** — no remediation to verify.

### Ready for QA

| Issue | Status | CVE | Summary | Created | Remediation Tasks |
|-------|--------|-----|---------|---------|-------------------|
| TC-9020 | Modified | CVE-2026-38901 | hyper - HTTP request smuggling [rhtpa-2.2] | 2026-05-15 | TC-9021 (Done), TC-9022 (Closed) |

Consider transitioning TC-9020 to ON_QA.

### Excluded from Ready for QA

| Issue | Status | CVE | Summary | Reason |
|-------|--------|-----|---------|--------|
| TC-9023 | In Progress | CVE-2026-39102 | rustls - Certificate validation bypass [rhtpa-2.1] | TC-9025 still In Progress |
| TC-9026 | Modified | CVE-2026-39330 | openssl - Buffer overflow in X.509 parsing [rhtpa-2.2] | No Depend links — no remediation to verify |
