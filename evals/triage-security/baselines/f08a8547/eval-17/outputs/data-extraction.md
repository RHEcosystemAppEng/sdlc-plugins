## Stream Scope Resolution

The issue summary contains the stream suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`, which maps to the **2.2.x** version stream in the Security Configuration Version Streams table:

| Stream | Konflux Release Repo | Local Path |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| 2.2.x | git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.4.z | /home/dev/repos/rhtpa-release.0.4.z |

This issue is **scoped** to the 2.2.x stream. Steps 3 and 4 will apply only to versions in the 2.2.x stream.

## Ecosystem Detection

The vulnerable library `quinn-proto` is a Rust crate. Based on the Ecosystem Mappings table in the security matrix, this falls under the **Cargo** ecosystem.

- Ecosystem: **Cargo** (source dependency)
- Lock file: `Cargo.lock`
- Check command: `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock`
- Upstream branch: `release/0.4.z` (for the 2.2.x stream)
- Remediation task count per stream: **2** (upstream backport + downstream propagation)

## Vulnerability Description

A vulnerability was found in quinn-proto. The quinn-proto crate before version 0.11.14 allows a remote attacker to cause a panic by sending a QUIC transport frame that creates an excessive number of streams. This vulnerability is classified as a denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability exists because quinn-proto does not properly validate the number of streams requested in a STREAMS frame.
