# Step 8 -- Remediation

## Triage Outcome

Based on the version impact analysis:

- **Case A (Affected)**: Stream 2.2.x has affected versions (2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2) within the issue scope. Create remediation tasks.
- **Case B (Cross-stream impact)**: Stream 2.1.x is also affected (all versions: 2.1.0, 2.1.1). Post cross-stream impact comment and create preemptive remediation tasks if no stream-specific CVE Jira exists for 2.1.x.

Since quinn-proto is a **Cargo** (source dependency) ecosystem, each affected stream requires **two tasks**: an upstream backport task and a downstream propagation subtask.

## Case A: Remediation Tasks for Stream 2.2.x (Issue Scope)

### Task 1: Upstream Backport Task

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.2.x)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`

#### Description

## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts.
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)

### Coordination Guidance

This component is public upstream. Coordinate fix with upstream maintainers
if the vulnerability is not yet public. Follow your organization's embargo policy before
discussing in public channels or PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

### Task 2: Downstream Propagation Subtask

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (2.2.x)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`

#### Description

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: `artifacts.lock.yaml` (download URL contains tag)
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

### Coordination Guidance

This component is public upstream. Coordinate fix with upstream maintainers
if the vulnerability is not yet public. Follow your organization's embargo policy before
discussing in public channels or PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: upstream backport task (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

---

## Case B: Cross-Stream Impact -- Stream 2.1.x

### Cross-Stream Impact Comment

Post to TC-8001:

> Cross-stream impact: quinn-proto < 0.11.14 also affects stream 2.1.x
> (versions 2.1.0, 2.1.1) based on lock file analysis.
> This stream is tracked by companion issues (see Related links)
> or may require separate PSIRT triage.

### Preemptive Remediation Tasks for Stream 2.1.x

If no stream-specific CVE Jira exists for 2.1.x (i.e., no sibling Vulnerability issue with CVE-2026-31812 label and `[rhtpa-2.1]` suffix), create preemptive tasks:

#### Preemptive Task 1: Upstream Backport (2.1.x)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.1.x)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`, `security-preemptive`

**Link type**: Related (to TC-8001, not Depend)

#### Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8001 (stream 2.2.x).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.

## Target Branch

release/0.3.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts.
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: 2.1.0, 2.1.1
Source commit(s): v0.3.8, v0.3.12

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

Note: The upstream branch release/0.3.z does NOT yet have the fix (quinn-proto 0.11.9). An upstream PR is required first to bump the dependency.

## Implementation Notes

- Target branch: release/0.3.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
