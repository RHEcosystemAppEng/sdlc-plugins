# Remediation Tasks for TC-8001 (CVE-2026-31812)

## Triage Outcome

- **Case A** (2.2.x -- scoped stream): Versions 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2 are affected.
  Versions 2.2.3, 2.2.4 already ship the fix (quinn-proto 0.11.14).
  Create standard remediation tasks.
- **Case B** (2.1.x -- cross-stream): All versions (2.1.0, 2.1.1) are affected.
  No stream-specific CVE Jira exists for 2.1.x.
  Create preemptive remediation tasks with `security-preemptive` label.

Ecosystem: **Cargo** (source dependency) -- two tasks per stream
(upstream backport + downstream propagation).

## Task 1: Upstream Backport (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.2.x)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`

**Link**: Depend -- inward: TC-8001, outward: this task

### Description

## Repository

backend

## Target Branch

release/0.4.z

## Description

Remediate CVE-2026-31812: quinn-proto panic on large stream counts.
The vulnerable dependency (quinn-proto < 0.11.14) must be updated
to the fixed version (0.11.14+).

Affected versions: 2.2.0 (v0.4.5, quinn-proto 0.11.9), 2.2.1 (v0.4.8, quinn-proto 0.11.12), 2.2.2 (v0.4.9, retag of 2.2.1)
Source commit(s): v0.4.5, v0.4.8

Upstream fix: https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/2048
Advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2026-qp73-x4mq

## Implementation Notes

- Update quinn-proto dependency to >= 0.11.14 in Cargo.lock
- Target branch: release/0.4.z
- Check for pinned versions or transitive dependency constraints
  that might prevent the bump
- If a direct bump introduces breaking changes, assess whether a
  code-level workaround is viable (see upstream changelog)
- Note: versions 2.2.3+ (v0.4.11+) already ship quinn-proto 0.11.14;
  verify that the fix is already on branch HEAD before creating a new commit

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] quinn-proto dependency is >= 0.11.14
- [ ] No other dependency conflicts introduced
- [ ] Existing tests pass

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Existing test suite passes with the updated dependency

## Dependencies

- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

## Task 2: Downstream Propagation (2.2.x)

**Summary**: Propagate CVE-2026-31812 fix: update backend ref in rhtpa-release.0.4.z (2.2.x)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`

**Links**:
- Depend -- inward: TC-8001, outward: this task
- Blocks -- inward: Task 1 (upstream backport), outward: this task

### Description

## Repository

rhtpa-release.0.4.z

## Target Branch

main

## Description

Update backend reference in rhtpa-release.0.4.z to pick up the
CVE-2026-31812 fix from the upstream backport task.

The upstream backport bumps quinn-proto to 0.11.14
on release/0.4.z. Once that PR merges, update the source pinning in this
Konflux release repo so the next build ships the fix.

## Implementation Notes

- Source pinning method: artifacts.lock.yaml (download URL contains tag)
- Update the backend reference to the merged commit or new release tag
- Verify the Konflux build pipeline triggers successfully

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] backend reference updated to include the fix
- [ ] Konflux rebuild triggers new container image

## Test Requirements

- [ ] Container image builds successfully with the updated reference

## Dependencies

- Depends on: Task 1 (upstream backport must merge first)
- Depends on: TC-8001 (parent tracking issue)

## Task 3: Preemptive Upstream Backport (2.1.x)

**Summary**: Remediate CVE-2026-31812: bump quinn-proto to 0.11.14 (2.1.x)

**Labels**: `ai-generated-jira`, `Security`, `CVE-2026-31812`, `security-preemptive`

**Link**: Related -- inward: TC-8001, outward: this task

### Description

> **Preemptive remediation**: This task was created proactively from cross-stream
> impact analysis of TC-8001 (stream 2.2.x).
> No stream-specific CVE Jira exists yet for this stream. When PSIRT creates one,
> this task will be linked and the `security-preemptive` label removed.
