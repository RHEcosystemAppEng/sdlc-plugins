## Stream Scope Resolution

The issue summary contains the stream suffix `[rhtpa-2.2]`, which maps to stream **2.2.x** in the Version Streams table:

| Stream | Konflux Release Repo | Local Path |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| 2.1.x | git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.3.z | /home/dev/repos/rhtpa-release.0.3.z |
| 2.2.x | git.example.com/rhtpa/rhtpa-release.0.4.z | /home/dev/repos/rhtpa-release.0.4.z |

**Issue stream scope**: 2.2.x (scoped issue -- Steps 3 and 4 apply only to this stream; Case A cross-stream analysis applies to other affected streams)

## Ecosystem Detection

quinn-proto is a Rust crate. The Ecosystem Mappings tables for both streams list **Cargo** as a configured ecosystem with:
- Lock file: `Cargo.lock`
- Check command: `git show <tag>:Cargo.lock`
- Upstream branches: `release/0.3.z` (2.1.x stream), `release/0.4.z` (2.2.x stream)

Cargo is a **source dependency** ecosystem per the classification table. This means remediation produces **2 tasks per stream**: upstream backport + downstream propagation (blocked).

## Deployment Context

The Source Repositories table does not include a Deployment Context column. Per backward compatibility rules, coordination guidance is omitted from remediation task descriptions.
