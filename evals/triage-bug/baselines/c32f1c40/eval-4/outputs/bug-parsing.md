### Issue Description

When calling the `/api/v2/advisories` endpoint with `filterDateRange` query parameters,
the response is missing the `X-Total-Count` and `Link` pagination headers. The response
body contains the correct filtered results, but clients relying on pagination headers
cannot determine total pages.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Start the backend service locally.
2. Call `GET /api/v2/advisories?publishedAfter=2025-01-01&publishedBefore=2025-06-30&limit=10`.
3. Inspect the response headers.

### Expected Result

The response should include:
- `X-Total-Count: <n>` header with the total number of matching advisories
- `Link: <url>; rel="next"` header when more pages exist

### Actual Result

The response body contains the correct filtered advisories, but the `X-Total-Count`
and `Link` headers are absent. Non-filtered requests (without `publishedAfter`/`publishedBefore`)
return pagination headers correctly.

### Environment / Version

Product version: 0.9.0
OS: RHEL 9.2
Deployment: OpenShift 4.14

None.
