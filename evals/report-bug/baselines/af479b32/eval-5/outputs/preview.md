**Summary (title):** Login page displays error after session timeout

**Labels:** `ai-generated-jira`

**Description:**

### **Issue Description**

After a user's session times out (30 minutes of inactivity), the login page displays a generic "Something went wrong" error instead of a friendly session-expired message.

### **Steps to Reproduce**

1. Log in to the application
2. Wait 30 minutes without any activity
3. Attempt any action (e.g., navigate to a new page)
4. Observe the error message on the login redirect

### **Expected Result**

The login page shows a user-friendly message: "Your session has expired. Please log in again to continue." The message should include a link back to the page the user was trying to access.

### **Actual Result**

The login page shows "Something went wrong. Please try again later." with no indication that the session expired. The return URL is lost.

### **Environment / Version**

RHTPA 1.5.0-rc1 on OpenShift 4.16.

### **Attachments**

- Screenshot of the error message
- Browser console log showing the 401 response

### **Suggested Fix**

Replace the generic error handler in the auth middleware to detect 401 responses caused by session expiry and return a specific error code that the frontend can use to display the correct message.
