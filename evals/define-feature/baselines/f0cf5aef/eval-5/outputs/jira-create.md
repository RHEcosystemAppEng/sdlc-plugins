  summary="Add automated PR review posting for eval results",
  description="## Feature Overview\n\nAdd a CI workflow step that posts eval results as a PR review comment on pull requests that modify skill definitions. When a PR changes a SKILL.md file, the CI pipeline should run the corresponding eval suite and post a summary of pass/fail assertions as a PR review. This gives reviewers immediate visibility into whether skill behavior changes break existing eval expectations.\n\n## Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Notes | Is MVP? |\n|---|---|---|\n| Post eval results as a GitHub PR review when SKILL.md files change | Use the GitHub REST API to create a review with pass/fail summary | Yes |\n| Include per-assertion results in the review body | Format as a Markdown checklist | Yes |\n| Handle the case where no evals exist for the modified skill | Post an informational comment instead of a review | Yes |\n| Update existing PR reviews when re-running evals on the same PR, rather than creating duplicate reviews | Use `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews/{review_id}` to update a previously submitted review | Yes |",
